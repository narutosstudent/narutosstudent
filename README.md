# ðŸ‘‹

I love to code. TypeScript and C is my current jam. ðŸ¤˜

I write on both my blog and newsletter.

I read on average two books weekly. If it isn't self-improvement, business or programming, I enjoy history.

My story summarized:

1. Moved from Sweden to Germany at 14.
2. Lost two academic years.
3. Dropped out of high school at 19 and began working as a Junior Frontend Developer.
4. Got my first promotion in 10 months.
5. 1.5 years later I landed two Senior Software Engineering offers.
6. Today? Pedal harder, loving the grind.

All about me:

- Programming
- Writer
- Naruto
- Anime
- Fitness
- Martial Arts
- Love to read
