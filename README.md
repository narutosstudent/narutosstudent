# Hi 👋

## I'm Tiger Abrodi 😸

I'm a Fullstack Developer based in Germany 🌳

### About Me 💕

I'd describe myself as a craftsman who crafts quality and accessible solutions 🌠

- Heavily into Accessibility, Testing, Development Methodologies and Programming Disciplines 👏 💪

- Swimming in Rust and TypeScript 🏊

- 📚 My favorite books (so far): [The Software Craftsman](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23215733-the-software-craftsman), [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4099.The_Pragmatic_Programmer), [Deep Work](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25744928-deep-work) and [Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44936.Refactoring) 💕

- 🔨 I enjoy building useful stuff like: [Madara](https://github.com/tigerabrodi/Madara), [Shisui](https://github.com/tigerabrodi/shisui)...

### Community & OSS 🥰

I also contribute to Open Source and volunteer in communities (KCD, Vitest, Testing Library, OSRG, react-i18next, Mock Service Worker) 🚀 💞
