### Hiya ðŸ‘‹

I'm Tiger.

I'd describe myself as a fullstack product developer. I'm not too fond of associating technologies with myself as I'm product oriented, but here are ones I've worked with:

- TypeScript
- Node
- Remix
- React
- Firebase
- Prisma
- Zod
- GCP
- AWS
- Terraform

### Other things I'm passionate about

- TDD
- Web Accessibility
- Product/Domain focused mindset
- Team building/knowledge sharing

### Hobbies (besides programming lmao)

Gym and Anime lol
